<h1> Assignment challenge 1 </h1>

<h2>Lip Syncing </h2>

<h2>By Chaitanya Kulkarni </h2>
 
 
side note  : the requiment.txt from the repo [https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip] was having issues to run on the google colab , hence the diffrent list of requirment was used by me , which is  present in the above repo under the same name . 

added the video sample used as input , the audio same used as input  and the result output as  result_voice(2).mp4 .
Added the Jupiter book above to present the code along with the pdf that contained the Assignment . 

thank you for reading :)
